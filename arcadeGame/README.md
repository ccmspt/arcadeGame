frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

This is my 3rd project in the Udacity Front End Developer program. It is a frogger clone game using javascript. Currently it has only basic functionality. Currently it only works with Chrome.

Files:
======
Index contains the HTML code
CSS folder contains CSS format file
images folder contains all the artwork for this game
js folder contains:
	app file : framework by Udacity and updated by me
	engine: given by Udacity 
	resources: given by Udacity

Loading Game:
=============
To load the game go to the folder named "frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game-master." Open the folder and right click the index folder and choose to open with the Chrome web browser. Chrome will open and automatically start the game. The player starts at the bottom. 

Controls:
=========
Using the arrow keys will control the player at the bottom. 

Object of Game:
===============
You must try to cross the road without getting hit by the bugs. If you get hit by a bug, you are return to the starting postion. If you make it to the water, you are return to the starting position again.

Credits and acknowledgements:
=============================
This project was created by me using the framework given to me by Udacity and also received a great deal of help using the Udacity forum discussions by other students and mentors.

Sorry I couldn't add more functionality to the game. It took me a while to understand OOP. If you have further questions, please mail me at ccmspt@hotmail.com.

Thanks for trying it!
